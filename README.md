A modern, responsive portfolio website built with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with GSAP animations.

- ðŸŽ¨ Tailwind CSS for styling
- ðŸŽª GSAP animations for smooth interactions
- ðŸ“± Fully responsive design
- ðŸš€ Optimized for performance
- ðŸŽ¯ SEO optimized with structured data

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (JavaScript runtime and package manager)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.10 (Stable)
- **Build Tool**: PostCSS with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin via Bun
- **Animations**: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- **Font**: Inter (same as Vue.js website)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Bun (latest version)
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rujealfon/rujealfon.github.io.git
cd rujealfon.github.io
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Start development with CSS watching:
```bash
bun run dev
```

This will watch for changes in your CSS and automatically rebuild the `dist/output.css` file using Bun and PostCSS.

### Building for Production

The CSS is automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions on every push to the main branch using Tailwind CSS v4's new engine.

For local production builds:

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates an optimized CSS file in `dist/output.css` using Bun with the Tailwind CSS v4.1.10 PostCSS plugin.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions with Bun to automatically:
- Build Tailwind CSS v4.1.10 on every push to main using Bun
- Deploy to GitHub Pages with the latest compiled CSS
- Ensure production CSS is always up-to-date

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/static.yml` and uses the official Bun setup action.

- **Vue.js colors**: `vue-green`, `vue-blue`
- **Nuxt-inspired palette**: `nuxt-dark`, `nuxt-accent`, `nuxt-surface`, etc.

### Fonts

The project uses Inter font family (same as Vue.js website) defined in the `@theme` block for optimal readability and modern appearance.
